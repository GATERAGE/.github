# RAGE is the Retrieval Augmented Generation Engine
# GATE is the General Automation Technology Environment
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the RAGE development component of the Advanced RAG Hackathon, hosted by [LabLab.ai](https://lablab.ai/event/advanced-rag-hackathon) entered as <a href="https://lablab.ai/event/advanced-rag-hackathon/mastermind">MASTERMIND</a> with RAGE. This hackathon focuses on the innovative integration and enhancement of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Participants will work on expanding the capabilities of RAGE (Retrieval Augmented Generative Engine) as a dynamic learning engine exploring new frontiers in Autonomous Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## About RAGE

RAGE is designed to enhance AI applications by integrating advanced retrieval techniques with generative systems as the Engine component of the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401v4">RAG</a>. This allows for more accurate, context-relevant outputs in real-time applications such as chatbots, content generation, and complex data analysis as a dynamic (R)etrieval (A)ugmented (G)enerative (E)ngine.
## Hackathon Goals

- **Innovate and Enhance**: Develop new features or improve existing functionalities of the RAGE engine.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate RAGE with other AI components to create more efficient and powerful systems.
- **Collaboration**: Work alongside fellow developers, share ideas, and combine expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible with RAGE.
- **Expression of RAGE**: as agnostic UI incorporating Vectara and together.ai components for dynamic training as machine dreaming
