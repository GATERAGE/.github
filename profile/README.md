# RAGE Development at Advanced RAG Hackathon

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the RAGE development component of the Advanced RAG Hackathon, hosted by [LabLab.ai](https://lablab.ai/event/advanced-rag-hackathon). This hackathon focuses on the innovative integration and enhancement of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Participants will work on expanding the capabilities of RAGE (Retrieval Augmented Generative Engine), exploring new frontiers in AI and machine learning.

## About RAGE

RAGE is designed to enhance AI applications by integrating advanced retrieval techniques with generative systems. This allows for more accurate, context-relevant outputs in real-time applications such as chatbots, content generation, and complex data analysis.
